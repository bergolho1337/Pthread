To measure cache misses we can use Valgrind. 

In order to do this first compile the source code by enabling debug information on compilation with:

$ gcc <source_code.c> -O2 -g -o <executable>

After that execute the program by calling Valgrind with the cachegrind tool activated.

$ valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./executable <input_parameters>

=============================================================================================================
Try to run this with the cache miss example.

The I1 miss rates tells us there was no instruction cache miss.

The D1 miss rates tells us there was a lot of cache L1 misses.

The LL miss rates tells us there was some Last Level cache misses.
